Working through RTSP

Pelco cameras have two streams `rtsp//camera-ip/stream1` and `rtsp//camera-ip/stream2` In my example below I use a Sarix Pro IBP519 and use the second stream from the camera. I have configured the stream to be 640x480 and 12ips but in the config.json you see that I use 30ips and this is that HomeBridge working this way. I took my second camera IME219 and to get the jpeg to work in this I needed to change the `stillImageSource` to be `-f mjpeg -i http://192.168.5.33/jpeg`

## config.json

```json
{
    "platform":"Camera-ffmpeg",
    "cameras":[
      {
          "name":"Baksidan",
          "videoConfig":{
            "source":"-i rtsp://192.168.5.34/stream2",
            "stillImageSource":"-i http://192.168.5.34/jpeg",
            "maxStreams":2,
            "maxWidth":640,
            "maxHeight":480,
            "maxFPS":30
          }
      }
    ]
}
```
