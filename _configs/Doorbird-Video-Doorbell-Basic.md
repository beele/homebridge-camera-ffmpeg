This works for me, it's for a Doorbird Video Doorbell, which I think uses the same hardware or at least same connection method as a Axis IP camera.

## config.json

```json
{
    "platform":"Camera-ffmpeg",
    "cameras":[
      {
          "name":"Front Door Camera",
          "videoConfig":{
            "source":"-i http://192.168.1.100:80/bha-api/video.cgi?http-user=username&http-password=password",
            "maxStreams":2,
            "maxWidth":640,
            "maxHeight":480,
            "maxFPS":3
          }
      }
    ]
}
```
