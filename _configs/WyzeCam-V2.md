As described in this [blog post](https://medium.com/dirigible/wyze-cam-homekit-58c4878c4124), I was able to get the WyzeCam V2 streaming to HomeKit with no transcoding and no custom compiling required using the following settings.

## config.json

```json
{
    "platform": "Camera-ffmpeg",
    "cameras": [
        {
            "name": "Wyze Cam",
            "videoConfig": {
                "source": "-i rtsp://username:password@192.168.0.100/live",
                "stillImageSource": "-i rtsp://username:password@192.168.0.100/live -vframes 1 -r 1",
                "vcodec": "copy"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
