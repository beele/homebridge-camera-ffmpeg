If you have a Blue Iris server, you can add any camera with the following configuration:

```json
{
      "platform": "Camera-IP",
      "cameras": [
            {
              "name": "My First Camera",
              "videoConfig": {
                "source": "-i http://user:password@serverip/h264/camshortname/temp.ts",
                "stillImageSource": "-i http://user:password@serverip/image/camshortname?q=75",
                "maxStreams": 2,
                "maxWidth": 1280,
                "maxHeight": 1024,
                "maxFPS": 15
              }
            }
      ]
}
```

- user/password - user with camera view permissions in Blue Iris
- serverip - The IP or hostname of your Blue Iris server
- camshortname - The short name of the camera in Blue Iris
- maxWidth/maxHeight - set to the camera native resolution

For example, you could use the following URL if for user:homebridge, password: password, server: bi.example.com, camshortname: driveway
`http://homebridge:password@bi.example.com/h264/driveway/temp.ts`
