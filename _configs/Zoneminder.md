works pretty well with zoneminder, using the ZM 'nph-zms' urls. Since the stream is already "cleaned up", it's pretty fast starting the stream as well. If you have a decent zoneminder setup (on a beefy server, since you need that anyway for motion detection), just run homebridge-camera-ffmpeg straight there.

## config.json

```json
{
  "name": "Sideyard Cam",
  "videoConfig": {
    "source": "-i http://localhost/zm/cgi-bin/nph-zms?mode=jpeg&monitor=<zm monitor id>&scale=100&maxfps=15&buffer=1000&user=<zm user>&pass=<zm passwd>",
    "stillImageSource": "-i http://localhost/zm/cgi-bin/nph-zms?mode=single&monitor=<zm monitor id>&scale=100&user=<zm user>&pass=<zm passwd>",
    "maxStreams": 2,
    "maxWidth": 1280,
    "maxHeight": 720,
    "maxFPS": 15,
    "debug": true
  }
}
```
