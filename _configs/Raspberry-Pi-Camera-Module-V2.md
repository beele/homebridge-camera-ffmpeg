I had to build ffmpeg with "--enable-libx264" to be able to use the "-tune zerolatency" from ffmpeg.js, and with "--enable-omx" and "--enable-omx-rpi" to use the GPU encoding

I had to remove from the homebridge-camera-ffmpeg code (ffmpeg.js) the resolution and scale for stillImage and videoStream to switch back to GPU encoding, and I now get a decent 10~20 FPS with pretty good video quality and ffmpeg using ~12% CPU on the pi zero

Still image sometimes don't refresh in homekit App : Need to reboot the iPhone to get it back ...
