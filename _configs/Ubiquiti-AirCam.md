Working without Ubiquiti NVR (running software UniFi Video), available on [Ubiquiti site](https://www.ubnt.com/download/unifi-video/) or via a direct RTSP connection to camera (older firmware, via ffmpeg).

Using <https://github.com/legotheboss/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg-omx> fork for RPi 3 support.

## config.json

```json
{
   "name":"Driveway",
   "videoConfig":{
      "source":"-rtsp_transport http -i rtsp://domain:port/4a1baa33-31a8-52f3-5524-12345aa111a7_0",
      "maxStreams":2,
      "maxWidth":1270,
      "maxHeight":720,
      "maxFPS":15
   }
}
```

### Notes:

- The RTSP stream can come from cameras or UniFi Video server (probably from the NVR too).
- Works remotely if you have Apple TV 4/iPad setup as a homekit hub.
- Running homebridge on Raspberry Pi 3.
- Streaming startup takes ~10s, thumbnails get generated automatically.
