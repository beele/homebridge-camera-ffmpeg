I had to use the OMX fork to get the PI 3 and FFMPEG to work more or less reliably.

## Camera Settings

I disabled WDR on the camera via the iOS app to get better frame rates at higher quality for my BlueIris setup using profile 5.

rtsp://username:password@IPAddress:554/profile5/media.smp

For the PI 3 I ended up using profile 2.

rtsp://username:password@IPAddress:554/profile2/media.smp

If you don't use the HD quality profile 5 or don't need/want higher frame rates when using it then you can experiment with WDR ON or OFF for your setup.

There are also other profiles to try:
rtsp://username:password@IPAddress:554/profile3/media.smp
rtsp://username:password@IPAddress:554/profile4/media.smp
rtsp://username:password@IPAddress:554/profile6/media.smp

## config.json

```json
{
   "platform":"Camera-ffmpeg",
   "cameras":[
      {
         "name":"CamNameHere",
         "videoConfig":{
            "source":"-i rtsp://username:password@ipaddress:554/profile2/media.smp",
            "maxStreams":2,
            "maxWidth":640,
            "maxHeight":360,
            "maxFPS":15
         }
      }
   ]
}
```
