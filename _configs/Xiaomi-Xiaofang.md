Note: I applied [Fang-Hacks](https://github.com/samtap/fang-hacks) to the camera to enable the RTSP stream.

I also reduced the RTSP output to 720p which is helpful when your Wi-Fi link is not great.

## config.json

```json
{
   "platform":"Camera-ffmpeg",
   "cameras":[
      {
         "name":"Camera 1",
         "videoConfig":{
            "source":"-rtsp_transport tcp -i rtsp://ip-address/unicast",
            "stillImageSource":"-i rtsp://ip-address/unicast -vframes 1 -r 1",
            "maxStreams":2,
            "maxWidth":720,
            "maxHeight":480,
            "maxFPS":10,
            "vcodec":"h264_omx"
         }
      }
   ]
}
```
