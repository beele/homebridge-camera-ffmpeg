If you'd like to contribute a camera configuration, you have two main options:

1. [Open a Tested Configuration Issue](https://github.com/Sunoo/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/issues/new?assignees=&labels=tested+config&template=tested_config.md) on the project and submit the details there.
2. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/Sunoo/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg) and [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/Sunoo/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/compare) after you make a new page.
